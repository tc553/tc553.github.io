title: My "The Office" inspired game
---

## How it all began

I'm a huge fan of NBC's sitcom [The Office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/). I first watched it a few years ago, and I remember the first time I saw episode [Booze Cruise](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0664511/) as if it had been yesterday. I literally had to pause the episode so I could get myself together, stop laughing and start paying attention again.

I've watched the entire series, and now I'm rewatching it following [Office Ladies](https://officeladies.com/), a podcast by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey. Each week, they discuss a new episode of The Office, talking about behind-the-scenes stories and interviewing other cast and crew members.

## The dream

All of that goes to say: I really like this TV show. And then something odd happened: one day I had a dream about a The Office-based game. In this game, Stanley Hudson was the main character, and the goal was to get through the day of work to finally go home at 5pm (which would be totally in character for Stanley).

I woke up thrilled by this idea. Coincidentally (was it?), this dream happened a week prior to a free game development course provided by [Alura Online](https://www.alura.com.br/) for which I had registered. I have about 5 years of professional experience in software development, but I always worked in projects for heavy industries. I had never had any experience with game development before (except a Snake game I developed 2 years ago, but it's really not the same thing).

## First steps into the game

Next thing I know, I'm drawing sprites for the game dev course and ellaborating ideas for the game. It must have pretzels; the scorecount will actually be a clock starting at 9am, and your goal is to avoid you boss and co-workers until you get to 5pm.

When there's a collision with another character, Stanley's stress level increases. If it gets from 0 to 100, he dies. Crosswords are collectable items, and in the game they work just as they would for Stanley in the show: time goes faster (clock timer fast forwards 30 minutes) and stress is reduced. And, of course, he has to collect pretzels!

## Next steps: game development and storytelling

This was my starting point. In the next posts, I'll talk more about the game dev course, my experience developing this game, the challenges I faced and, of course, lots of The Office references.
