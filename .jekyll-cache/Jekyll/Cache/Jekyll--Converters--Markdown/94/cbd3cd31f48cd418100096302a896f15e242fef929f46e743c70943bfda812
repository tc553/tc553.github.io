<p>I’m a huge fan of NBC’s sitcom <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/">The Office</a>. I first watched it a few years ago, and I remember the first time I saw episode <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0664511/">Booze Cruise</a> as if it had been yesterday. I literally had to pause the episode so I could get myself together, stop laughing and start paying attention again.</p>

<p>I’ve watched the entire series, and now I’m rewatching it following <a href="https://officeladies.com/">Office Ladies</a>, a podcast by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey. Each week, they discuss a new episode of The Office, talking about behind-the-scenes stories and interviewing other cast and crew members.</p>

<h2 id="the-dream">The dream</h2>

<p>All of that goes to say: I really like this TV show. And then something odd happened: one day I had a dream about a The Office-based game. In this game, Stanley Hudson was the main character, and the goal was to get through the day of work to finally go home at 5pm (which would be totally in character for Stanley).</p>

<p>I woke up thrilled by this idea. Coincidentally (was it?), this dream happened a week prior to a free game development course provided by <a href="https://www.alura.com.br/">Alura Online</a> for which I had registered. I have about 5 years of professional experience in software development, but I always worked in projects for metals industry. I had never had any experience with game development before (except a Snake game I developed 2 years ago, but it’s really not the same thing).</p>

<p>Next thing I know, I’m drawing sprites the game dev course and ellaborating ideas for the game. It must have pretzels; the scorecount will actually be a clock starting at 9am, and your goal is to avoid you boss and co-workers until you get to 5pm.</p>

<p>When there’s a collision with another character, Stanley’s stress level increases. If it gets from 0 to 100, he dies. Crosswords are collectable items, and in the game they work just as they would for Stanley in the show: time goes faster (clock timer fast forwards 30 minutes) and stress is reduced. And, of course, he has to collect pretzels!</p>

<p>Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).</p>
