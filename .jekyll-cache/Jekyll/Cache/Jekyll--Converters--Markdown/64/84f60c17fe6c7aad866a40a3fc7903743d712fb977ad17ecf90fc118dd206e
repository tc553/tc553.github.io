<p>I‚Äôm a huge fan of NBC‚Äôs sitcom ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù. I first watched it a few years ago, and I remember the first time I saw episode ‚ÄúBooze Cruise‚Äù as if it had been yesterday. I literally had to pause the episode so I could get myself together, stop laughing and start paying attention again.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve watched the entire series, and now I‚Äôm rewatching it following <a href="https://officeladies.com/">Office Ladies</a>, a podcast by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey. Each week, they discuss a new episode of The Office, talking about behind-the-scenes stories and interviewing other cast and crew members.</p>

<h2 id="the-dream">The dream</h2>

<p>All of that goes to say: I really like this TV show. And then something odd happened: one day I had a dream about a The Office-based game. In this game, Stanley Hudson was the main character, and the goal was to get through the day of work to finally go home at 5pm (totally in character for Stanley).</p>

<p>I woke up thrilled by this idea. Coincidentally (was it?), this dream happened a week prior to a free game development course provided by <a href="https://www.alura.com.br/">Alura Online</a> for which I had registered. I have about 5 years of professional experience in software development, but I always worked in projects for metals industry. I had never had any experience with game development before (except a Snake game I developed 2 years ago, but it‚Äôs really not the same thing).</p>
